My name is Channacy (cha-nan-cee) and I am a sophmore at Drexel University and majoring in computer science. I started coding at 16 and since then have been keen on developing and expanding my knowledge of computer science through independent learning and in classes. My main interests cover web and mobile app development, AI, and cybersecurity.
