My name is Channacy (cha-nan-cee) and I am an undergraduate pre-junior at Drexel University majoring in computer science. I started coding at 16 and since then have been keen on developing and expanding my knowledge of computer science through independent learning and in classes. My main interests cover a broad range of web and mobile app development, AI, and cybersecurity. Currently, I am working on an NLP project for text analysis.

😇 **A Quick Intro** 

-  👩🏻‍💻 I am involved in multiple related areas of research in 3 research labs at Drexel: IS4H, H2 Design Lab, GLIDE lab where I focused on the intersection of informatics, health, social media, and learning. So far, I had a wide breath of exposure to various fields but I am hoping to narrow down my interests towards data science and analytics. 
- 🏫 I am heavily involved in activities outside learning! I am the current vice president of WiCS, HACK4IMPACT and event planning lead for Drexel CHI as well as upcoming founder/president of the GWC(Girls Who Code) - Drexel College Loop.. Peviously, I served as UX/UI lead of HACK4IMPACT, marketing chair/newsletter manager of WiCs (Women in Computing Society). I believe the college experience extends itself outside classes and giving back towards the community is part of my identity :)
